# Node.js First Project with Postman

This project demonstrates the basics of setting up a Node.js application and using Postman for API testing. It is designed as a beginner-friendly guide to building and testing simple RESTful APIs.

## Features

- **Node.js**: The project uses Node.js to create a server and handle API requests.
- **Postman**: APIs are tested using Postman to verify their functionality.
- **Express Framework**: Simplifies server creation and routing.
- **JSON-based APIs**: The project handles data in JSON format.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher recommended)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) for API testing
- A code editor (e.g., [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hirwacedric123/First-Node-project.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the required packages:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Server
Start the server using:
```bash
node index.js
```
The server will start at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### 4. Test the API
Use Postman to test the API endpoints. Examples of routes include:

- `GET /api/data` - Fetches sample data.
- `POST /api/data` - Accepts JSON data and logs it to the console.

## API Documentation

### GET `/api/data`
- **Description**: Retrieves a list of sample data.
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "data": ["example1", "example2"]
  }
  ```

### POST `/api/data`
- **Description**: Accepts and logs JSON data.
- **Request Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "Sample Name",
    "value": 123
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "message": "Data received successfully"
  }
  ```
